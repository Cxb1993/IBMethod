# IBMethod
The IBMethod repository contains codes developed for the Immersed Boundary Method.

IBKernels
* contains codes for computing IB kernels and routines for computing weights used in force spreading and velocity interpolation.
* Matlab codes for IB kernels are stnd3pt.m, stnd4pt.m, bspline4pt.m, flex6pt.m. 
 bspline4pt_d.m and flex6pt_d.m computes the first derivative
